## Challenges for Databases in Containers

-   **Persistence**:
    
    -   Containers are ephemeral by default, meaning their internal data is lost when the container stops or restarts.
        
    -   Databases require persistent storage to retain state across restarts or re-deployments.
        
    -   Solution: Use mounted volumes or Kubernetes PersistentVolumes to store data outside the container lifecycle.
        
-   **Networking**:
    
    -   Containers have dynamic IP addresses and isolated networks, which can complicate stable connectivity between services.
        
    -   For databases, stable endpoints and service discovery are crucial.
        
    -   Solution: Use container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to expose services via ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer and manage DNS-based service names.
        
-   **Security**:
    
    -   Databases often store sensitive data and are prime targets for attacks.
        
    -   Running databases with elevated privileges or improper network policies can expose them to risk.
        
    -   Solution: Implement least privilege access, secure credentials using secrets, and apply network policies and container image scanning tools.
