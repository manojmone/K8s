## What is Containerization?

-   Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that packages an application and all its dependencies into a single unit known as a container.
    
-   These containers can run consistently across various environments—laptops, on-prem data centers, or cloud platforms.
    
-   **Example:** A PostgreSQL database container includes the PostgreSQL engine, required libraries, configuration files, and can be deployed quickly on any machine with Docker installed—ensuring predictable performance regardless of the host system.
