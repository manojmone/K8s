## Common Use Cases

-   **Dev/Test Environments**:
    
    -   Developers and DBAs can spin up isolated, disposable environments that mirror production in seconds.
        
    -   Example: A DBA can test schema changes on a containerized copy of production PostgreSQL without affecting the actual environment.
        
    -   Simplifies onboarding, reduces configuration drift, and encourages experimentation.
        
-   **CI/CD Automation**:
    
    -   Containers enable seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, versioning, and deployment of database services.
        
    -   Example: Integrate containerized MySQL setup with GitHub Actions to validate DB changes, apply migrations, and spin up preview environments on pull requests.
        
    -   Ensures consistency and repeatability in deployment workflows.
        
-   **Hybrid/Multi-Cloud Portability**:
    
    -   Containers abstract away infrastructure differences, making it easier to move workloads across on-prem, cloud, or hybrid environments.
        
    -   Example: A containerized MongoDB instance can run identically on AWS, Azure, or GCP, ensuring operational consistency.
        
    -   Reduces vendor lock-in and simplifies disaster recovery strategies.
